# Posts
- When creating a post with images, make a corresponding directory in `assets/images` that corresponds to the post's file name (ex. Post File: `_posts/2024-08-20-hobo-cams.markdown`, Image Dir: `assets/images/hobo-cams`)
  - To link an image, add `![FTODO](/assets/images/FTODO/FTODO)` to markdown file
